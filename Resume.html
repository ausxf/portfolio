    <h2>My Resume</h2>
    <img src="../portfolio/Asset/Gambar/2.png" />
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My name is Firdaus i am web developer. My strength is to build website. My skill including build website from strech HTML, CSS, Java, Node.js, Express.js,and Mysql database.
    I can build as customers want. My skill rate is 8/10. 
    I can build service in web such Amazon AWS, manage linux service and more. 
    This is one of my personal project during my spare time.
    Surely maintaining is not easy, i believe with knowledge i have and important part is EXPERIENCE with the code and debugging
    problem, i can figure out how to solve the problem. I may not know everything, but if is new to me, is part of my self improvement
    to learn and new experiences. Perhaps, the master is also start from 0 skills. Its about ourself to keep solving and learning,
    I have my philosophy , to gain so much knowledge and keep practicing. Gain Knowlege is easy, but when comes to execute, 
    it will difficult for some peoples. I believe who already as a GOOD/MASTER Programmer, they must execute lot of an error at the 
    beginning, difficulty, challange, and hard working and lots of time spending on computer. the hustle is not easy.
    At any skills or anything we learn if we want to master it, we need to sacrifice our time. Needless to say, is 
    commitment is the vital part of learning.</p>
